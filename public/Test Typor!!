Test Typor!!


multiple keyboards
text generation
user stats
leaderboards:{
	wpm, learning rate, 
}

pause clock when inactive typing for some time

check keyboard - only like 8 keys can light up at a given time

instead of header with login and info, sidebar    <-----        this



potential problem - shift+keypress does not bind keyup event. timeout is currently used
	in keypress event function to un-highlight on screen key
